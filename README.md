Structured data extractor for the modern world wide web.

## What is this?

Have you ever tried to extract valuable information quickly to create a JSON file for a REST api from a site and were simply too misled by the local hotties ads?

We have a simple solution - just use this tool to extract all the good data from any website using three different state of the art methods.

JK - this is an implementation of a relatively simple data extractor for creating more structured files with information from websites using regular expressions, XPath and a RoadRunner-like approach. It is implemented for the purposes of the second assignment in the Web information extraction and retrieval course.

## Brief guidelines (for development)

When writing regex, either explain it (comment the code) like you would explain it to a monkey or use something other than regex for solving the problem.
Comment non-obvious code.
